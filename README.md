# JSON Tabulator

Upload a JSON file, select a valid node, and display it's contents in a table format.

In addition you can format the table and finally export the result to CSV.

## Setup

You can run the whole show locally from your local client system. No installation required, there is no web-server where to upload your files.

Only thing you need is a modern browser that supports the Javascript File API.

The default installation uses the [Javascript Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) community edition. For a lot of more powerful options, make sure the obtain the enterprise license and change the Javascript resource in the ```index.html```.

## License
